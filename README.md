Hello!

Please create a responsive website based on this mockup. The website needs to be responsive, mobile-friendly, and it has to work across multiple browsers. Feel free to use Bootstrap or another framework that will help you to complete this task.

On mobile devices, tile the content so the image for each section appear above the text portion. Use your discretion for how all elements should be styled for mobile.

For desktop view, we would like to keep the height of the sections constant, as given in instructions, and the text content should be kept near the center of the screen. For larger displays, we would prefer for the images to stretch to the left and the right of the screen (do not set max-width). In other words, as the width changes (and the height stays the same), we’d like the image to fill the horizontal space, focusing on the key area of the photo, while maintaining the aspect ratio of the photograph itself.

Please submit the completed task as HTML & CSS files (or a single file) to thefidelisgroup@gmail.com.
Please include any assumptions that you had to make while completing this task, and don't forget to include your name, so we can tie your submition to your resume.
